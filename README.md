## I'm Vyygir

### I write a hell of a lot of code, but you can't see it

A lot of the code I work on is for my place of work, so within private repositories. A lot more of it is for my own projects, but I don't want them to be released yet so, again, within private repositories. Anything that's public is outdated and likely to be archived or deleted soon.

👨🏻‍💻 I've been writing code since I was 14
💾 Over the years, I've worked with PHP and many frameworks underneath it
✨ JavaScript is what all the cool kids are currently using
⚡️ I'm also currently working on a game
📧 Feel free to email me question about work or to ask to collaborate
❌ Do not email me recruitment offers or job roles
