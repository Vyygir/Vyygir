#### I write a hell of a lot of code, but you probably can't see it

A lot of the code I work on is for my place of work thus within private repositories.

Anything public is outdated and likely to be archived or deleted soon.

- 👨🏻‍💻 I've been writing code since I was 14
- 💾 Over the years, I've worked with PHP and many frameworks underneath it
- ✨ JavaScript is what all the cool kids are currently using
- 🔧 Rust is my new favourite fad
- ⚡️ I'm also currently working on levelling up my game development skills
- 📧 Feel free to email me questions about work or to ask to collaborate
- ❌ Do not email me recruitment offers or job roles
